# Java-Ping-Pong-Game
2 player ping pong game using java GUI libraries (AWT , Swing)

Features :  
● It’s a very simple to play 2-player fun game.  
● It’s a score-based game meaning both players can compete with each other 
for winning.  
● At the start of each round the new balls appears at any random point on 
centre y-axis line.  
● Also the new ball follows any random direction to shoot at start of each round 
so neither of player get any initial advantage.  
● In order to make this game more fun, I designed the game in such a way 
that every time ball bounces back, the speed of ball increases a little. Making 
players harder to hit the ball with each successful hit.
